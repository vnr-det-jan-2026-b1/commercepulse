YOUR MISSION:
1. Verify every single ₹ amount, percentage, and metric mentioned in the plan against the RAW DATA SNAPSHOT.
2. If the plan says something generic like "Increase traffic", rewrite it to be mathematically specific based on the data.
3. Output the fully corrected, mathematically authentic ExecutiveActionPlan.
4. If the plan is already accurate, just output it exactly as is, but increase the confidence_score slightly.

Do NOT add new actions. Only correct the numbers, math, and specificity of the existing actions.
